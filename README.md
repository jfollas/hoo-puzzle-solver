_My experiment with using voice as input for tedious data_

While doing the Hivemind quests in WoW, I came across a complex puzzle for the yellow monacle. There is a solver add-on 
that requires you to enter all colors/shapes in the grid, but that in itself took about 30-45 minutes just for the data
entry. That's when I thought, "I wonder if I could write something that would let me just say the colors instead of clicking?"

## Requirements
- Chrome, more than likely.  I didn't test in any other browsers, and probably won't. I accept pull requests (or you can fork this repo).
- Internet connectivity (Chrome uses Google's cloud for the voice recognition)
- A microphone
- Speakers/sound helps for the audio cues provided.
- Multiple monitors so that you can run WoW on one and Chrome on another.
